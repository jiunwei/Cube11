# Cube11

This is a modified version of Microsoft's [Cube11 example](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Cube11-DirectX-9-to-3b16f777) that uses standard C++ and plain WinAPI calls instead of C++/CX and the UWP/Windows Store API.

It also serves as working code that can be used with the [Get started with DirectX for Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn643743.aspx) tutorial, since that tutorial does not include all the required source files for some reason.
